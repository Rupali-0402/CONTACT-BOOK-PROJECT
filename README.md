# CONTACT-BOOK-PROJECT
Project Description
Overview

The Contact Book is a simple command-line application that stores, searches, updates, and deletes contacts using a linked list data structure. Each contact contains a name, phone number, and email address. The application ensures contacts are inserted in alphabetical order for easier management. To preserve data between sessions, the contact list is saved to and loaded from a JSON file.

Features

Linked List Storage: Uses a self-referential linked list to store contacts dynamically.

Alphabetical Sorted Insertion: New contacts are inserted in the list alphabetically by name.

Search: Find contacts by exact name.

Update: Modify phone number and/or email for existing contacts.

Delete: Remove contacts from the list by name.

Display All Contacts: View the full sorted list of contacts.

File Persistence: Load contacts from and save contacts to a JSON file (contacts.json).
